ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Walmart Store Sales Forecasting

ðŸ”§ Tools & Tech Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Lasso, Data Visualization

âœ… Description:

Developed a predictive model to forecast weekly sales across 45 Walmart stores using historical sales, holiday, and economic data.

Merged datasets (train, features, stores) and performed feature engineering to extract week numbers and convert holiday flags.

Applied Linear Regression and Lasso Regression for performance optimization and dimensionality reduction.

Achieved Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of ~8.9% and plotted actual vs. predicted results to visualize model accuracy.

Used one-hot encoding for store-based features to improve model performance and handle multicollinearity.

Evaluated model using mean squared error and cross-validation techniques to validate robustness.
